<h3>How To Setup</h3>
<p>Set up is fiarlyt easy. Follow the steps below to</p>
<ol>
    <li>Extract the zip file to anywhere you want.</li>
    <li>Navigate to project directory to project location using <code>cd</code>.</li>
    <li>Migrate the migrateion files using the <code>php artisan migrate</code> command.</li>
    <li>Start the server using the <code>php artisan serve</code></li>
 </ol>


 <h3>Challenges</h3>
 <p> As for the challenges in this project it weas short and simple so the most challengese I faced were a few syntax errors here and there but not too many major ones</p>

 <h3>Design</h3>
 <p>For the design I wanted ton make it as simple and seemless as possible so all I did was add one single text ionput and a sumbmit button for the main interface.</p>


 <h3>Future improvements</h3>
 <p>For future improvements for the URL shortener app I can probably add AJAX to the form or maybe provide the user with some more analytics on the links instead of only the amount of times the link is clicked</p>
